# Surveillance

This is a simple iOS app that will connect to your Unifi NVR, grab the IP addresses of all your cameras, and then display each of the cameras.

### Usage

On first load, the app will ask you for the IP of your Unifi NVR and an API key.

You can get an API by navigating to your NVR web interface, selecting `Users` at the bottom left, select a user (or make a new one) then selecting API Access.

You will also need to enable anonymous snapshots on each of your cameras. You can do this by navigating to each one of your cameras IP's, logging in, and enabling anonymous snapshots.
